            Visual Studio Code is an html software that we use to make websites. To set it up, first of all, you need to make a new folder. Make sure the folder is organized in the correct place. Then, go to the Visual Studio Code that you have downloaded. Click open folder and select the folder to code. Right click on the left side of the gray bar that says your project name. If you see "new file", click on the file and name it "index.html". Now you should be ready.
